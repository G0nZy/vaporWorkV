        <h4 id="journalSubTitle">Environment</h4> <p id="journalText"> 
            This is a continuation on the thoughts I found reading an article by Another Mountains Rock & you can check out 
            the article from Seeking Alpha <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4433526-csgo-skin-market-reflections-on-crypto-speculation-search-for-high-yield">here.</a>
            This article was one of many inspirations that got me thinking. Wait, this whole NFT thing Valve basically started. Not only that,
            but they could be raking in alot more cash & providing alot more value to customers if they cared at all about the implications of 
            web3.
        </p>
        <h4 id="journalSubTitle">Thesis</h4>
        <p id="journalText">Valve could easily control & dominate the online PC gaming NFT market (But they won’t). 
            NFT’s have been in the headlines for many different reasons. We won’t touch on that today. Today we will 
            be speaking about what an NFT Game MarketPlace would look like if it were run by Valve.

            An example of an in game economy/marketplace would be the one found in the game counterstrike global offensive. 
            In counterstrike a player can purchase an in game item from a market of other players selling that item. Items are 
            acquired through “Loot Crates” which act as a sort of a game of roulette. Basically a player through the process of playing 
            the game is gifted crates at random. In these crates contain skins differing in rarity.
